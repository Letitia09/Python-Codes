Write a program to find the special two-digit numbers.

Note: A special two-digit number is a number such that when the sum of the digits of the number is added to the product of its digits, 
the result is equal to the original two-digit number.

Example 1:

Input: 59.

Output: 59 is a Special Two-Digit Number

Explanation:

Sum of digits=5+9=14
Product of its digits = 5 x 9 = 45
The sum of the sum of digits and product of digits = 14+45=59

Example 2:

Input: 29

Output: 29 is a Special Two-digit Number

Explanation:

Sum of digits=9+2=11
Product of digits=9*2=18
The sum of the sum of digits
and product of digits 11+18=29

Input format:

The first line of input consists of the number N of elements in a tree.
The next input consists of N elements of the tree separated by space.

Output format:

The output displays the count of special two-digit numbers in the given tree.
